## QuizzCode
I try  to create code for some sort of Quiz board.
This is my first own project,
so I'll try to implement as many of the best practices I learned at uni as possible.

For the start I will most likely neglect this documentation,
as I can't really tell how much effort the coding itself is going to be.
